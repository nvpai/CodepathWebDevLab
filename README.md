# CodePath Web Programming Lab - Fall 2024

This repository contains projects created while taking the **CodePath Web Programming course**, where I learned **React.js** and modern web development concepts. These projects demonstrate my understanding of React fundamentals, component-based architecture, state management, and API integration.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **RESTful APIs**
- **Node.js**

## Projects
Each project focuses on different aspects of React and web development:

1. **TimeTabled** - A grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week.
<!-- 2. **[Project Name]** - Brief description of what it does.
3. **[Project Name]** - Brief description of what it does. -->

## Key Learnings
- Building interactive UI with React
- Managing state and props
- Handling API requests and responses
- Implementing React Router for navigation
- Enhancing performance with hooks and optimizations
